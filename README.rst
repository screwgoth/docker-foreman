docker-foreman
==============

Disclaimer: This is a fork of `Dan McDougall's <https://github.com/riskable/docker-foreman>` excellent `Dockerfile <https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/>`_ and supporting
scripts for running `Foreman <http://theforeman.org/>`_ inside a
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ container.  It is based on
`phusion/baseimage <https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/phusion/baseimage/>`_
which is a modified version of Docker's default 'ubuntu' image.

The image is configured to use the
`'1.13' Ubuntu 16.06 Xenial repository <https://theforeman.org/manuals/1.13/index.html#3.3.3DebianPackages>`_

This Docker image was created so that can happen :smile: .  If I've made a horrible mistake somewere please
`open an issue <https://github.com/screwgoth/docker-foreman/issues/new>`_.

Building
--------
It is recommended that to build this Docker image like so::

    docker build -t foreman /path/to/docker-foreman/.

This will create a new docker image named "foreman" using the Dockerfile in
this repository.  Replace ``/path/to/docker-foreman/.`` with the correct path on
your system.

Running
-------
It is recommended that you run the image like so::

    docker run -t --hostname="foreman.company.com" --name=foreman -p 8443:443 -p 8080:80 foreman

That will run the image in a new container with the hostname,
'foreman.company.com' (replace with your own hostname) named, 'foreman' with
ports 80 and 443 inside the container exposed as ports 8080 and 8443,
respectively.

The first time the container is run it will execute the
`first_run.sh <https://github.com/riskable/docker-foreman/blob/master/first_run.sh>`_
script which calls ``foreman-installer --reset-foreman-db`` and
``foreman-rake permissions:reset`` to reset the Foreman database and provide new
credentials for the 'admin' user.  These credentials will be displayed so make
sure to take a note of them so you can login after it's done starting up.

**NOTE:** The ``first_run.sh`` script only runs
``foreman-installer --reset-foreman-db`` *once*.  If you ``docker commit`` the
container (say, after an ``apt-get update && apt-get upgrade``) it will not
reset the database unless you remove the ``/etc/foreman/.first_run_completed``
file.

Known Issues
------------
There's some (mostly minor) issues with the image...

SmartProxy Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I have not tested Foreman's SmartProxy in this image so I don't know if it
works.  What I *do* know is that when you build the image ``foreman-installer``
will output errors like this::

    E, [2014-09-19T01:27:00.689495 #381] ERROR -- : ge: 365/366, 99%, 0.0/s, elapsed: 00:05:39
     /Stage[main]/Foreman_proxy::Register/Foreman_smartproxy[foreman.example.com]: Failed to call refresh: Could not load data from https://foreman.example.com
     /Stage[main]/Foreman_proxy::Register/Foreman_smartproxy[foreman.example.com]: Could not load data from https://foreman.example.com

I don't know what the consequences of that are are but I do believe it has
something to do with the fact that the hostname of the image isn't set to an
FQDN when the image is built.  I'm *hoping* that by passing the ``--hostname=``
option to ``docker run`` corrects the problem.  Maybe someone that knows more
about Foreman can provide more detail (
`open an issue <https://github.com/riskable/docker-foreman/issues/new>`_).

Install Plugins and Extra Tools
